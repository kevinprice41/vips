					<p class="lead">Experts estimate that 80 - 90 % of early
						learning occurs through the use of vision. Therefore, young
						children who are blind or visually impaired are at risk of
						experiencing significant delays in development. The sooner these
						children can receive developmental intervention tailored to their
						blindness, the sooner they can begin to catch up and achieve
						optimal functioning. VIPS offers a variety of programs and
						services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of young children
						who are blind or visually impaired and their families. These
						services are designed to mitigate developmental impacts of visual
						impairment by teaching children to use other senses to gather
						information and to use remaining vision to best advantage.

					<h3>The Curriculum</h3>
					<p>
						The VIPS Preschool uses the Kentucky approved Creative Curriculum
						that encourages hands on exploration, independence, and social
						development. This is supplemented by a vision-specific, expanded
						curriculum for particular skills, tasks and modifications, based
						on each child's individual needs. In addition, music therapy
						services are also provided in weekly group and individual sessions
						to further reinforce appropriate social, behavioral, and academic
						skills. Teachers are trained and experienced in both early
						childhood education and severe vision difficulty<br /> <br />
						Our preschoolers have had one-on-one time with real dance
						instructors from Thats Dancing, teaching us tap and ballet steps
						once a week. The children have learned imitation skills, important
						motor skills, how to follow directions and many other skills that
						help them become more well rounded students and many have made
						strides regarding their confidence and independence.<br /> <br />
						We are beginning to have regular cooking classes with Rob Henry,
						the head chef at Sullivans The Bakery, making things like pumpkin
						pie, decorating ginger bread house and eventually making cookies,
						breads, etc. We will also have a visiting artist, Aron Conaway,
						from the Louisville Visual Arts Association working with us on
						different types of ways to incorporate art in the classroom.

					<h3>Kosair Charities Kids Town</h3>
					<p>
						Kids Town is modeled to contain features of a real-life town
						square, where each child can build concepts about the world and
						how it works in a safe, protected, yet functioning setting. <br />
						<br />The Goal of Kids Town is to promote independence, concept
						development, orientation and mobility skills, and gross motor
						skills. The Kids Town environment emphasizes real life skills,
						having a Chase Bank, grocery, child sized working kitchen, KFC
						Drive Thru Restaurant, Laundromat, and Dr. Mark Lynn's (Eye
						Doctor) Office.
