					<p class="lead">In one form or another, you may be asking

						I go from here?” Your situation may be different, but it is not
						unique. Many families have asked those same questions when faced
						with the same situation. Children with visual impairments are
						children first. They need the same types of experiences as other
						children. They need to have friends, to play in sandboxes, to
						swing on swings, to go to new places. They need to be part of
						family routines and activities.</p>
